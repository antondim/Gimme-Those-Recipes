# Web-Scraping
This Python project, is an attempt to scrape free access (as stated in robots.txt) text data from an online cooking website, in order to produce statistics.

## Getting Started
Scraping, is a way of collecting text data from websites, taking advantage of their html source code.

Python provides plenty of libraries capable of handling "html" source code, for web scraping.

In this project, we make use of the following libraries:

- BeautifulSoup: Library for extracting data from HTML and XML files

- Selenium: Library, that provides API to access websites' data through a WebDriver (Firefox, Chrome etc)

- Pandas: Library, providing high-performance, convenient data structures and data analysis tools
